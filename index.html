    <h1>Brief Introduction</h1>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <p>My name is Chidiebube Ezeonyeche, a resilient self-starter with intermediate experience in Website Development.</p>

    <h3>My Background In Tech</h3>

    <p>I studied computer science in school, which ignited my passion for creating unique and amazing applications, 
        especially since I initially wanted to go for Computer Engineering, lol. Given that, I have a good understanding of the concepts of how 
        computer programs are written/created and have worked on some projects of my own.</p>

    <p>I took a break from learning tech due to some physical reasons during NYSC and switched to Virtual assistance -
        which I do now, but here I am trying to get back to doing what I really have passion for and love doing.</p>
    

    <h3>My Expectations From The Upskill Program</h3>

    <p>I actually signed up for the program to find the motivation to pursue my tech career since I wasn't doing quite 
        great determination-wise on my own, hence I wanted the motivation and energy that submissions and deadlines give.</p>

    <p>You know the famous saying; I can do all things as long as there's a looming deadline and serious consequences, lol.</p>

    <p>But having found that, I'm also looking forward to increasing my knowledge, upskilling in every sense 
        of the word, and meeting new people who share the same passion!</p>
